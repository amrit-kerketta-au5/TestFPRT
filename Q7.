Difference between INNER and OUTER JOIN.

Inner and outer joins are combine rows from two or more tables into a single result using a join condition. 
 The join condition specifies how columns from each table are matched to one another.
   In most cases, the aim is to find equal values between tables, and include those matches.

The most common case for this is when you’re matching the foreign key of one table to the primary key of another, 
such as when using and ID to look up a value.

Though both inner and outer joins include rows from both tables when the match condition is successful, 
they differ in how they handle a false match condition.

Inner joins don’t include non-matching rows; whereas, outer joins do include them.
