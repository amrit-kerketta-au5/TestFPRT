What is Cache? Where does cache lie in an Operating System? Difference between Cache and HashMap.


A cache -- pronounced CASH -- is hardware or software that is used to store something, usually data, temporarily in a computing environment.

A small amount of faster, more expensive memory is used to improve the performance of recently accessed or frequently accessed data 
that is stored temporarily in a rapidly accessible storage media that's local to the cache client and separate from bulk storage. 
Cache is frequently used by cache clients, such as the CPU, applications, web browsers or operating systems (OSes).



Cache memory lies on the path between the CPU and the main memory. 
It facilitates the transfer of data between the processor and the main memory at the speed which matches to the speed of the processor.
