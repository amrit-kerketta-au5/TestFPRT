How will you analyze 'process out of memory exception' in your node js application? 


Taking Snapshots Of The V8 Memory

Let's play with the Memory tab a bit. The simplest option available is Take heap snapshot.
 It does what you expect: it creates a dump of the heap memory for the inspected application, with a lot of details about the memory usage.

Memory snapshots are useful to track memory leaks. 
A usual technique consists of comparing multiple snapshots at different key points to see if the memory size grows, when it does, and how.

Watching Memory Allocation In Real Time

Another method to measure the memory allocation is to see it live instead of taking multiple snapshots.
 To do so, click on Record allocation timeline while the siege simulation is in progress.
